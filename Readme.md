SpeedFood - System Overview
1. Project Overview
SpeedFood is a multi-platform food ordering and delivery system designed to help users conveniently order food through web and mobile applications without needing to physically visit restaurants or food stores.
The platform acts as an intermediary service between customers and delivery drivers. Customers can browse food items, place orders, and track delivery progress in real time. Delivery staffs receive order notifications, accept available orders, purchase the requested food, and deliver it directly to customers.
The system supports both web and mobile platforms to increase accessibility for customers and delivery drivers.

7. Order Workflow
The main workflow of the system is:

2.The system creates a new order with pending status.
3.Available staffs receive realtime order notifications.
4.One staff accepts the order.
5.The system assigns the order to the selected staff.
6.Staff purchases the requested food.
7.Staff delivers the food to the customer.
8.Customer receives the order and completes payment if using COD.
9.The order status becomes completed.

8. Delivery Fee Strategy
SpeedFood uses a distance-based delivery fee model.
The delivery fee is calculated based on the distance between the customer location and the food store location.
Example delivery fee ranges:
Distance	Delivery Fee
0 - 2 km	10,000 VND
2 - 5 km	15,000 VND
5 - 8 km	20,000 VND
More than 8 km	25,000 VND
The total order price is calculated using:
Total Price = Food Total + Delivery Fee
This pricing strategy helps balance delivery costs while maintaining a reasonable customer experience.
